# Changing-Text

## Description
This repository creates a browser-based text editor that operates as a single-page application and fulfills the criteria of a Progressive Web App (PWA). It should incorporate various data persistence techniques to ensure redundancy in case certain options are not supported by the browser. Furthermore, the text editor is capable of functioning offline.
